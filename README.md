Dragonball Z Dashboard Milestone Project

This milestone project is a japanese orientated animated tv program that has had many series over the years. Dragon Ball Z first aired in Japan on Fuji tv from 26th April, 1989 to 31st January, 1996.
From then it was dubbed into relevant languages across the world and became a bit hit in the US. As part of the Dragon Ball media francise it was aired in more than 81 countries. It started out as Dragon ball,
then the new series took over and became a lot peoples favourite animated show calling itself Dragon ball z it made 17 films and created a massive amount of games which many only released in Japan. Dragon Ball
GT aired in 1996 to 1997 which became a follow up to the cultural icon series Z. Then came Dragon Ball Super, you could say this is the series that caught a lot of fans unaware and is helping the Dragon Ball Francise
as popular as ever. It took a brief interval break but it is confirmed to come back in July by the shows creator and animator Akira Toriyama.

This project is a dashboard showing different types of data collected to show out of 201 participants, how many were male or female, how long they have been a fan of the series, how old they are and which series is 
their favourite. I will be using d3.js and dc.js to help visualise my data and bring it to life. 

I created this dashboard for people who are interested in finding just how popular the Dragon Ball francise is. It is not only for them to find out how popular it is, but to find out different types of information. For example
out of the information that was recorded, how many people loved the Dragon Ball series, but who were male or female and also finding out their age.

As a user type, I want to find out the average age of the males for the Dragon Ball Super series. First the user would have to select SUPER from the select menu at the top and the graphs will auotmatically change according what has been
selected. The user would then go to the Average age graph located on the right hand side bar chart. The user can just move the mouse over to the make side of the chart and it will tell you the average age of the males that have selected 
Dragon Ball Super as their favourite series.

As a user type, i would like to find out how many females watch the the franchise and how long they have been watching it. First the user would have to select the female bar on the Number of people barchart located on the left hand side,
then user would have to scroll down to the scatter graph and it will show you how many females what the show and if you hover over each plot, it will show their age and for how long they have been watching.

As a user type, i would like to cancel my selection and take me back to the starting point on the chart. All the user would have to do to cancel their selection is to just select the same chart they clicked on or to completly reset it just
by going to the select bar and click on select all and all the charts will be refreshed and back to thier orignal position.



I have used a mixture of different charts to show how the user has a variety of options to find out information for instance, one feature I have implemented was the average graph once a series has been selected or male or female chart has been
clicked on it gives the average age for male and female and which show that has been selected. This is all from the data that was collected.

A feature that I have implemented has been the age and how long they have watching scatter graph. When the relevant series has been selected you can scroll down on the scatter graph and just hover over each dot and find out the age of the person 
how long they have been watching that particular show. I have used the colour blue for males and the colour orange for females, so they can see which sex group is on that particular dot.


A feature I would like to implement would be percentages of each series of the 201 participants, for example on the pie chart i would like to create a pie chart showing each show and their percentages.

Another feature i would like to implement would be a stacked bar chart with all different series represented in the male and female bars and having each section of the stacked chart colour coded.

Bootswatch website: https://bootswatch.com/flatly/ i downloaded the theme flatly to automatically style my website. It is helping me add the font of the text that i like without specifying it in the style.css section.

dc.js: I used this to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. The charts i created are rendered using dc.js and are reactive which provides an instant feedback to what the user is interacting with. dc.js a wonderful javascript library to see your data come to life not
just in the web browser but on mobile devices also.

crossfilters: I used Crossfilter alongside dc.js because it allowed me to filter and group specific data on the go, it goes well alongside dc.js which has been used to build this dashboard. You can see this by clicking on many different charts and using the filter at the top.

d3.js: I used this to help bring my dashboard to life by using html and css.

I have got friends and family to test out various issues with the data dashboard, for instance, different types of web browsers were used from firefox, google chrome and microsoft edge. 

Number of people chart was tested by clicking on the male and female sides of each bar the avereages bar moved instantly along with the scatter graph. 

The series selector at the top was tested thoroughly from clicking each series multiple times, refreshing the page and selecting the "Z" series straight away, clicking on he female bar and
selecting the "BALL" series. Each series was tested by family on different web browsers at the same time and continue switch back and fourth between male and female bars to represent the dat on 
all the graphs.

The Scatter graph was also tested repeatedly by again selecting each series on different web browesers and hovering over random dots to see the age of the participant and how long they have been watching. 
This is double checked by looking at each points of the graph to confirm it is correct information being shown on screen.

I have also found a bug with google chrome which sometimes it needs to be refreshed to load the data quick rather than take a second to think and then refresh itself. This is an issue that has been reproted to me
and i am currently investigating the issue.

I commited all changes and backed all my data up to Github and created a repository and called it dashboard_project. I put the description as my second mile-stone project. I clicked create and went to my cloud9 project of dashboard_project and added all the necessary files to download for
example the dc.js and d3.js but also included the css styles also. I then used the command "git init", then i used git add to add all the relevant files to be commited.I then typed in the command line "git status" to check all the files had been added. I then entered in "git commit -m "initial commit"
to commit the changes to my local repository. Now that I commited I then pushed it to github. I did this by copying and pasting the push an existing repository from a command line, line. I pushed enter and then copy and pasted the second line to push it " git push -u origin master"
I then had to enter my username and password for github.

Once i finsihed my website and all my commits, I was ready for deployment which I went to settings under my project and then down to github pages. I then Chose "Master Branch" and clicked save.

The image I used to add as background image on my dashboard is from a google search by typing in 7 Dragon balls used from this website :https://www.google.com/search?q=7+dragon+balls&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV6rbjuNPhAhV0ThUIHaIkCzwQ_AUIDigB&biw=1366&bih=625#imgrc=1eKcqZGhirxTVM:

I used some info to start my opening sentences from the Dragon Ball Wikipedia page by grabbing relevant information :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball

i would like to say a massive thank you to the teachers at Code Institute on the course by following lessons, I was able to bring my dashboard alive. So i would like to say thank you for making it understandable.

I was inspired to create this dashboard about Dragon Ball because it takes me back to my child hood and it reminds me that i was lucky enough to enjoy the series with others. This TV show taught me more than i would liek to let on for example,
it taught me working hard to meet you goals is only ever a good thing and it can only improve yourself as a person. Another example would be teamwork in the "Z" series with teamwork you will find things easier to accomplish and being part of team you will never be alone,
in one of the episodes they needed to use teamwork to defeat an enermy.
